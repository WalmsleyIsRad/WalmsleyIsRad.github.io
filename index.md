# Intro 9/7/2018

This week I learned that we need to listen to directions closely. Respect yourself, others, and the community. I learned about the print string of Python. I learned that you need to not forget parentheses and quotation marks. I learned that the first windows system was Windows 1. I learned that the interface has no correlation with how the computer runs.

# Variable and Expressions 9/14/2018

This week I learned about how to add strings. I learned how to concatenate variables. I learned that you need a space in quotation marks to have space between two or more words. I learned that the string is the biggest of the four types of coding. I learned that boolean was named after George Boole. I learned to not miss this class for the command post.

# Conditionals 9/21/2018

This week I learned about if statements. I learned that if, elif, and else must have a colon afterwards. I learned that elif is else if. I learned that we can if statements within other if statements. I learned that elif makes the program not run line by line all the time. I learned that how to create a random number generator.

# Lists 9/27/2018

This week I learned how to create a list. I learned that if you want to print only the first string in a list, you have to type list[0]. I learned how to code and produce a graph. I learned how to write boolean statements in an if statement. I learned that you can print certain things from a list. I learned that you can type integers and strings into a list and it will function.

# Loops Part 1 10/5/2018

This week I learned how to add to a list. I learned how to remove something from a list. I learned how to print the list in all caps. I learned how to print the list backwards. I learned the basics of a for loop. I learned that a loop will repeat code as many times as you want it to. 

---

# Loops Part 2 10/12/2018

This week I learned that I overcomplicate my code. I learned that you need to split up each step in a program in order to make coding simpler. I learned that for loops and lists are very important in coding. I learned that going in for tutorial will make my life easier. I learned how to change variable types. I learned that 1 gigbyte is HUGE.

# Dictionaries 10/19/2018

This week I was introduced to dictionaries. I learned that you need french brackets to create a dictionary. I learned that each key has a value in the dictionary. I learned that you can have lists inside dictionaries and dictionaries inside lists. I learned that you use the regular brackets to do anything else with a dictionary except create it. I learned that coding takes time and patience.

# While Loops/Scope 10/26/2018

This week I learned about how while loops work. I also learned about the scope of a variable. The scope was described when a variable was active. I also learned how to print words in all caps. I learned that indenting matters when you want certain code to be placed inside the loop and also outside the loop. I learned that variables created inside the loop are only active inside that loop.

---

# Functions 11/2/2018

This week I learned about the basics of functions. I learned that you have to type def to create a function. I learned that you have to code the functions at the upper lines of code and have the testing part below. I learned that you can call the function at any point in time. I learned that you can have a function within another function. I learned that function are very hard to understand when you have functions withing function.

---

# Recursion 11/9/2018

This week I learned about recursion. I learned about the difference between recursion and iteration. I learned that recursion is basically repeating a function within itself. I learned that you do not need a loop for recursions. I learned that recursion can happen a number of times and not infinitely. I learned that recursion is like a piece of paper that is twisted and taped to the end as seen in the video you showed us.

# Classes 11/16/2018

This week I learned about classes. I learned that you define classes like functions, but there are no parenthesis an you can capitalize the class name. I learned that you have to put self in every function within the class. I learned that you have to have self.variable name for each variable defined in a function within a class. I learned that classes are used for organization of code. I learned that you call a class the same way you call a fuction. I learned about the __init__ function.

---

# Classes cont. 11/30/2018

This week we continued to learn about classes. Classes help group functions and can be called. We learned about the __init__ function of python. We also learned that you should import things at the top of the code so you don't have to import multiple times. We learned that 
that you can just use the shuffle cards using python, but we did it the hard way. We learned that about the raise function in python.

---

# Go Fish 12/7/2018

This week we learned about how to code the game go fish. We learned how to import code from another program. We learned about the Exception part of coding. We learned about the ValueError part of coding. We learned you need booleans to affect the code. We learned that you can call functions from another program if they are imported.

---

# Raspberry Pi 12/14/2018

This week we started out projects on the raspberry pi. I learned that two people could execute a file at the same time and both of them popped up. I learned how to rotate the visuals. I learned how to change the color of the text. I learned how to display a single pixel in an array of pixels. I learned that the ip addresses are a little different depending upon the person.
